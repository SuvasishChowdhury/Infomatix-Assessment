# Infomatix-Assessment
Infomatix Web Technologies
Overview
This exercise consists of building a Minimal API Backend using .NET and a Angular front end project. The goal is to focus on quality, reusability, and scalability rather than just finishing the tasks.

Backend
Requirements
Implement APIs for the following functionalities:

Add a new ticket to an existing project.
Add subtasks to an existing ticket.
Assign projects to existing users.
Assign tickets to existing users.
Assign subtasks to existing users.
List Tickets to show list of all assigned ticket which need to .
Project Structure
The backend follows a modular structure:

/ticketapi
â”‚â”€â”€ /Modules         # Modules register endpoints and services
â”‚â”€â”€ /Services        # Handles data extraction and logic
â”‚â”€â”€ /Models          # Data models for the ticket database
â”‚â”€â”€ /Data/TicketDbContext.cs  # Entity Framework Core DbContext
â”‚â”€â”€ Program.cs       # Application entry point
â”‚â”€â”€ appsettings.json # Configuration settings
Setting Up the Backend
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have .NET 7+ installed. Run the following command to install dependencies:

dotnet restore
2. Run Database Migrations
To create the SQLite database and apply migrations:

dotnet ef migrations add SampleMigration --output-dir Data/Migrations
dotnet ef database update
3. Run the API
Start the backend:

dotnet run
By default, the API will be available at http://localhost:5000/swagger (if Swagger is enabled).

Frontend
Requirements
Implement a UI with the following features:

A list view displaying projects and users.
A card showing the total count of projects and tickets.
A data table displaying users and their assigned tickets.
Project Structure
The frontend follows a component-based structure:

/ticketui
â”‚â”€â”€ /src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /features      # Standalone components grouped by feature
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /services      # API calls and data fetching
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json       # Project dependencies
Setting Up the Frontend
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js 16+ installed. Run the following command:

npm install
2. Run the Development Server
To start the frontend:

npm run start
Soruce code process
Create a seperate branch.
Raise a PR when done.
Send an email with the PR link.
Branch Name should be your firstName-frontend or firstName-backend. Example if your firstname is James then valid branch name will be James-Frontend.
Guidelines
Use standalone components inside /features.
Use signals if possible for state management (optional, but recommended).
Use SCSS for styling instead of plain CSS.
Follow best practices for reusability and maintainability.
Notes
Prioritize quality, reusability, and scalability over merely completing tasks.
Ensure modular design principles for both backend and frontend.
Use best practices for database interactions and API structuring.
Happy coding! ðŸš€
